[26/11/24, 3:57:52 PM] Lex De Guzman: Or does someone else want to be group leader?
[26/11/24, 3:59:19 PM] Timothy: Im okay with anything
[26/11/24, 3:59:44 PM] Vimal: I thot we already said andreigo was the group leader

[26/11/24, 4:17:14 PM] Lex De Guzman: Aight can
[28/11/24, 10:38:11 AM] Timothy: Week 15 – showing plan is needed

Rn we need to show a concrete solution and plan to tackle
Eg adding and subtracting inventory, show what products lost

Eg pe teacher dunno when to buy equipment
What if inventory loss exceeds a certain amount and then buy new stocks

What is practical workflow?
-not schedule workflow
It means how a person uses the app-
Eg proposal app needs to be used out of the blue – poor workflow
Eg app wants to check inventory
-	Do u have RFID? How do u tag the items?
-	People buy certain things doing what-
-	Need to show app workflow starts from where, key in products, click checkout

At the end of the day, dump everything inside github, flowchart, slides, etc,
[30/11/24, 9:50:01 PM] Timothy: guys
[30/11/24, 9:50:08 PM] Timothy: we have a week until teacher will check progress
[30/11/24, 9:50:11 PM] Timothy: we need to start
[1/12/24, 5:11:44 PM] Timothy: Do we have any ideas
[1/12/24, 5:32:25 PM] Lex De Guzman: How bout logistics type companies? ‎<This message was edited>
[1/12/24, 5:32:51 PM] Lex De Guzman: Then software solution could be inventory management
[2/12/24, 7:23:18 PM] Lex De Guzman: Hey sorry @6583895482 ,we ended discussing quite a bit of the proposal in class.

We still need to flesh out some details but we got the main idea

Our chosen company is jollibee.We want to help with customer loyalty and engagement.

The scratch project will be a loyalty points system.Where the users can play games and earn points,which can then be used to redeem certain items

I'm thinking we do maybe main menu and 2-3 games first.Then if we have enuff time,we add on more
[2/12/24, 7:25:16 PM] Timothy: oh sure
[2/12/24, 7:25:21 PM] Timothy: did you discuss with teacher?
[2/12/24, 7:26:40 PM] Lex De Guzman: Yes
[2/12/24, 7:36:58 PM] Timothy: hmm okay
[2/12/24, 7:37:12 PM] Timothy: would be interesting to make a game
[2/12/24, 7:37:17 PM] Timothy: we have a GitHub repo right?
[2/12/24, 7:37:26 PM] Timothy: i have an idea or two
[2/12/24, 7:37:33 PM] Timothy: and we should document stuff too right
[2/12/24, 7:38:33 PM] Timothy: do you think it would be funny if i ported my mii maker code
[2/12/24, 7:38:46 PM] Timothy: bootleg miis 🔥
[2/12/24, 7:39:07 PM] Lex De Guzman: Very
[2/12/24, 7:39:26 PM] Lex De Guzman: Sounds hella overkill for what we need
[2/12/24, 7:39:52 PM] Timothy: but but but you can argue that it helps connect the customer to the branddd 😔
[2/12/24, 7:40:07 PM] Timothy: ok if i can port it in a few days i can toss it in the project
[2/12/24, 7:40:43 PM] Lex De Guzman: How does porting work tho with scratch being block coding?
[2/12/24, 8:28:51 PM] Timothy: I know the instructions
[2/12/24, 8:28:55 PM] Timothy: The process
[2/12/24, 8:28:59 PM] Timothy: Could just replicate it
[2/12/24, 8:29:13 PM] Timothy: and the code is meant to work with different scales too so its doable
[2/12/24, 8:29:22 PM] Timothy: user icon and can use it in a game
[2/12/24, 8:29:40 PM] Lex De Guzman: Isn't ur thing also for 3d engines?
[2/12/24, 8:32:04 PM] Timothy: the face is 3d textures overlaid onto a 3d model
[2/12/24, 8:32:07 PM] Timothy: *2d
[2/12/24, 8:40:34 PM] Timothy: but yeah just an idea bc. i think it would be funny
[3/12/24, 8:05:25 PM] Vimal: guys
[3/12/24, 8:05:32 PM] Vimal: dis Thursday after sch
[3/12/24, 8:05:53 PM] Vimal: want meet up after class to discuss abt the slides

[3/12/24, 8:07:19 PM] Timothy: in an app right?
[3/12/24, 8:07:27 PM] Vimal: ya
[3/12/24, 8:07:43 PM] Timothy: only a game or got menu… points redeem etc?
[3/12/24, 8:07:43 PM] Andreigo: then we code via scratch
[3/12/24, 8:07:48 PM] Vimal: ye
[3/12/24, 8:07:53 PM] Vimal: everything scratch
[3/12/24, 8:08:09 PM] Andreigo: like if you complete the game then you can redeem points in the jolibbe app
[3/12/24, 8:08:30 PM] Andreigo: there already exists a jolibee app but there is not a lot of features
[3/12/24, 8:08:35 PM] Vimal: ya smthing liddat
[3/12/24, 8:08:40 PM] Andreigo: so we tryna improve on that
[3/12/24, 8:08:44 PM] Timothy: so wait do we recreate the app then
[3/12/24, 8:08:51 PM] Timothy: Like a mini version
[3/12/24, 8:08:51 PM] Timothy: Or
[3/12/24, 8:08:55 PM] Vimal: idk abt dat
[3/12/24, 8:08:59 PM] Andreigo: no we just add like additional features
[3/12/24, 8:09:03 PM] Vimal: wat u all want do
[3/12/24, 8:09:07 PM] Andreigo: for the app

[3/12/24, 8:14:19 PM] Timothy: 😨
[3/12/24, 8:14:25 PM] Vimal: Wait who will be in charge of managing the github repository
[3/12/24, 8:14:30 PM] Timothy: lex?
[3/12/24, 8:14:33 PM] Timothy: Isnt he the owner
[3/12/24, 8:14:34 PM] Lex De Guzman: Yea

[3/12/24, 8:15:14 PM] Andreigo: Lol rip old jolibee app
[3/12/24, 8:15:38 PM] Andreigo: I think its like web publishing where we code like a diff segment of the project
[3/12/24, 8:15:44 PM] Vimal: Oh ok
[3/12/24, 8:15:48 PM] Andreigo: maybe idk
[3/12/24, 8:15:53 PM] Lex De Guzman: For the scratch project.think we can just make it a standalone app with the basic points system,then just suggest it be integratred into a jollibee app?
[3/12/24, 8:15:53 PM] Vimal: Can u list out all the segments
[3/12/24, 8:16:03 PM] Vimal: So each person can be assigned one
[3/12/24, 8:16:09 PM] Andreigo: yep that can work lex
[3/12/24, 8:16:13 PM] Lex De Guzman: Maybe an "online" menu if we have to?
[3/12/24, 8:16:18 PM] Andreigo: sure
[3/12/24, 8:16:31 PM] Andreigo: but our main priority should be the minigames rite?
[3/12/24, 8:16:45 PM] Lex De Guzman: That and points rewarded

[3/12/24, 8:26:01 PM] Lex De Guzman: Tryna do everything component on 1 scratch file will get messy.So i suggest we do each part on separate projects,then I combine them manually
[3/12/24, 8:26:14 PM] Andreigo: alright got it

[3/12/24, 8:37:34 PM] Lex De Guzman: Seems like it's similar to how we did consultation where we give background,problem,solution,purpose,details
[3/12/24, 8:37:56 PM] Vimal: Do we need to tell abt our roles oso
[3/12/24, 8:39:04 PM] Lex De Guzman: Doesn't explicitly say.However, I suggest we do but keep it brief

[5/12/24, 9:21:28 AM] Vimal: I ini know it app is e learning

[7/12/24, 3:45:14 PM] Timothy: Just realised did i tell y’all i was working on an avatar system
[7/12/24, 3:45:19 PM] Timothy: I think only lex know
[7/12/24, 3:45:31 PM] Timothy: bc i was bored and seemed decently easy so 😪
[7/12/24, 6:43:14 PM] Timothy: guys
[7/12/24, 6:43:25 PM] Timothy: we REALLY need to do the slides
[7/12/24, 6:43:38 PM] Andreigo: im finishing mine tonight
[7/12/24, 6:44:18 PM] Timothy: this is at 1 page rn 😭

[7/12/24, 6:45:10 PM] Timothy: im doing rn
[7/12/24, 6:47:54 PM] Timothy: @6588123660 who will do the background and all slides
[7/12/24, 6:47:58 PM] Timothy: like the what do u call it
[7/12/24, 6:48:16 PM] Timothy: talking about jolibee, what it is, how we will improve the app etc
[7/12/24, 7:24:14 PM] Lex De Guzman: Sure,I'll do it.ik it's gonna be last minute,but I can only start working on the slides tmr
[7/12/24, 7:24:39 PM] Lex De Guzman: Oh btw,the games are confirm only meant for pc right?
[7/12/24, 7:28:23 PM] Timothy: i mean technically its on scratch…but we ARE technically making them for a mobile app
[7/12/24, 7:28:34 PM] Timothy: So should keep that in mind still
[7/12/24, 7:29:33 PM] Lex De Guzman: I feel like cuz scratch doesn't fully have mobile support,It'd be more difficult
[7/12/24, 7:29:53 PM] Lex De Guzman: And limiting to just pc would make it easier.
[7/12/24, 7:32:44 PM] Timothy: Gonna be honest i dont really get why you need to ‘limit to just pc’
[7/12/24, 7:32:53 PM] Timothy: like what would the difference be
[7/12/24, 7:34:16 PM] Lex De Guzman: Scratch can only detech 1 screen tap at a time
[7/12/24, 7:35:56 PM] Lex De Guzman: It doesn't have to be a mobile app right? Like we could say it could be integrated to a website of theirs or a pc app
[7/12/24, 8:41:43 PM] Timothy: I thought the plan was mobile app? Are we changing it now?

[8/1/25, 12:06:00 PM] Timothy: that should be fine
[14/1/25, 8:05:04 AM] Lex De Guzman: @6592322749 It's probably easier for me to just also create the points system.Is it alright if you make a game for the scratch project instead? Or do you still want to create the points system?
[14/1/25, 9:01:32 AM] ~ yujie: yeah can
[16/1/25, 8:52:27 PM] Lex De Guzman: Should I add sound effects to my menu buttons?

[19/1/25, 6:52:27 PM] Timothy: ~should add text~
[19/1/25, 6:57:11 PM] Lex De Guzman: Do u need the text engine?
[19/1/25, 7:22:01 PM] Timothy: how does that work?
[19/1/25, 7:23:52 PM] Lex De Guzman: Like how to use it?
[19/1/25, 7:23:54 PM] Timothy: yeah
[19/1/25, 7:28:07 PM] Lex De Guzman: Use the write block i made and input "text" "x" "y" "size" "align" to write.

Align defaults to left if not "c" or "r"

Use 'broadcast clear text' to clear text
[19/1/25, 7:29:49 PM] Lex De Guzman: Scratch only allows 300 clones for the whole project,not per sprite.So max 300 characters(260-290 if you're using clones for something else )
[19/1/25, 7:30:42 PM] Lex De Guzman: Spaces don't contribute to clone count
[19/1/25, 8:58:48 PM] Timothy: I see I see
